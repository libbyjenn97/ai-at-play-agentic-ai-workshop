## watsonx Orchestrate
As detailed in the [Solution Architecture](./images/o2c-arch-sb.png), we will build and deploy the majority of the agents for the solution in watsonx Orchestrate. AI Agents are autonomous entities that can run tasks, decide and interact with their environment. In IBM watsonx Orchestrate, agents are a key component of our agentic AI framework, enabling the creation of complex, dynamic systems that can adapt and respond to changing conditions. 

### Accessing watsonx Orchestrate
To access watsonx Orchestrate, follow these steps:

1. If not already logged into your IBM Cloud account, navigate your preferred browser to https://cloud.ibm.com and log in with your credentials (which you used for your TechZone reservation).

2. On your IBM Cloud landing page, click the top left navigation menu (hamburger menu) and select **Resource list**.
*Note: If you are a member of multiple IBM Cloud accounts, make sure you are working in the correct account which has the required services available as explained in the [environment-setup](https://github.ibm.com/skol/agentic-ai-client-bootcamp/tree/release/v3.0.0/environment-setup) guide.*
![IBM Cloud Resource List](./images/ibm_cloud_resources.png) 

3. On the Resource List page, expand the **AI / Machine Learning** section, and click the **Watsonx Orchestrate** service service name.
![IBM Cloud wxo](./images/ibm_cloud_wxo.png) 

4. Click **Launch watsonx Orchestrate** to launch the service.
![wxo launch](./images/wxo-launch.png) 

5. Once watsonx Orchestrate service is launched, you would be at its landing page as illustrated in the figure below. You will see an intuitive conversational interface with a chat field where you can type any text to start interacting with watsonx Orchestrate. When you start with a new service instance, there will be no custom agents defined and thus, the section under **Agents** will state *No agents available*. You can either click **Create or Deploy** an agent under the Agents section or you can click **Create new agent** to start developing new agents. You can also select the **Manage agents** link to navigate to the agent management page.
Try to type a few generic questions and observe the responses from the large language model (LLM) powering the prebuilt agent in watsonx Orchestrate which ensures basic functionality until custom agents are created.
![wxo landing page](./images/wxo-landing-page.png) 

## Order-to-Cash Agent Creation
In this section, you will go through the process of creating an AI agent in watsonx Orchestrate:

6. To start building agents, you can click the **Create new agent** link as referenced in step 5 or alternatively, click the top left navigation menu, expand the **Build** section and select **Agent Builder**. This will redirect you to the Manage agents page.
![wxo agent builder](./images/wxo-nav-menu-agent-builder.png) 

7. The Manage agents page will initially be blank since no agents have been created yet. As you create more and more AI agents that can reason and act, the Manage agents page will be populated with those agents. Click **Create agent** button to start building your first agent.
![wxo create agent](./images/wxo-create-agent-manage-agents-empty.png) 

8. On the Create an agent page, select **Create from scratch** tile, provide a **Name** and a **Description** for the agent and click **Create**.

Name: ```Order-to-Cash Agent```

Description: 
```
This Supervisor Agent orchestrates and manages the flow of conversation by intelligently routing user queries to the appropriate specialized agents based on the context.
The Supervisor Agent oversees two domain-specific agents:
1. Order Management Agent
2. Customer Support Agent
It also handles general queries by routing them to a knowledge base.
```

Watsonx Orchestrate supports creating an agent from scratch or from a template which involves browsing a catalog of existing agents and using attributed of another agent as a template for the new agent. For this lab, you will be creating agents from scratch.

![wxo order to cash agent](./images/img20.png) 

### Agent Configuration 
After the AI Agent is created, in this section, you will go through the process of configuring the agent with knowledge and tools to enable it to respond to queries using information from the knowledge base and perform tasks using the tools.

9. Next, you will go through the process of configuring your agent. The Order-to-Cash Agent page is split in two halves. The right half is a **Preview** chat interface that allows you to test the behavior of your agent. The left half of the page consits of four key sections that you can use to configure your agent.

   - Profile: The **Profile** section consists of the description of the agent which you provided as part of creating the agent. You can always go to this section to edit and refine the description of the agent as needed.

   - Knowledge: The **Knowledge** section is where you can add knowledge to the agent. Adding knowledge to agents plays a crucial role in enhancing their conversational capabilities by providing them with the necessary information to generate accurate and contextually relevant responses for specific use cases. You can directly upload files to the agent, or connect to a Milvus or Elasticsearch instance as a content repository. Through this **Knowledge** interface, you can enable your AI agents to implement the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pattern which is a very popular AI pattern for grounding responses to a trusted source of data such as enterprise knowledge base.

   - Toolset: While *Knowledge* is how you empower agents with a trusted knowledge base, then **Toolset** is how you enable agents to take action by providing them with *Tools* and *Agents*. Agents can accomplish tasks by using **Tools** or can delegate tasks to other **Agents** which are deeply skilled in such tasks.
   
   - Behavior: The **Behavior** section of the agent configuration is where you provide instructions to the agent to define how it responds to user requests and situations. You can configure rules that dictate when and how the agent should take action. These rules help the agent behave in a predictable and consistent manner, delivering a seamless user experience.

   - Channels: The **Channels** section is where you can connect your agent to the channels your team uses to communicate (under preview). You can enable your agent to communicate via teams, WhatsApp with Twilio, Facebook messenger, Genesys Bot Connector.

Lastly, after you've completed your agent configuration and tested its performance, you can **Deploy** the agent to make it available through the selected channel. At this time, the main channel supported is the *Chat* home page you access when you first launched watsonx Orchestrate. The product will be adding support for additional channels where you can deploy your agent(s).

![wxo create agent config](./images/img21.png) 

10. On the agent configuration page, review the *Description* of the agent in the **Profile** section and keep as is (no edits necessary). Next, scroll down to the **Knowledge** section, or click the **Knowledge** shortcut. In the Knowledge section, add a description to inform the agent about the content of the knowledge. For this lab, add the following description as we will provide the agent with a Order to Cash process FAQs document.

Description: 

```This knowledge addresses all the queries related to Order to Cash process.```

Next, you have to choose how to provide knowledge information to the agent. Watsonx Orchestrate supports adding knowledge to the agent either by uploading files directly through the UI or by pointing to a content repository (Mivlus or ElasticSearch). For this lab, click the **Upload files** button to upload pdf files.

![wxo agent config knowledge](./images/img35.png) 


Drag and drop the following pdf files to upload to the knowledge for the agent :
   - [Order to Cash FAQs.pdf](./Order_to_Cash_FAQs.pdf)


11. Once the files are all uploaded to the knowledge base, you can start testing the agent to validate how it can respond to questions using this knowledge base. The uploaded files get processed and prepared to be leveraged by the agent. After the upload completes, test the agent by asking a few questions such as:

```What should I do if there is an issue with my order delivery, such as delays or damaged goods? ```

```What payment methods are accepted?```

You should see the responses being retrieved from the uploaded documents and then the final response generated by the agent as illustrated in the figure below.

![wxo agent knowledge test](./images/img37.png) 

At this time, it is worthwhile taking a moment to reflect on what you've developed so far. You have design an agent and empowered it with a knowledge base to enable it to respond to queries in context using its knowledge base. *Congratulations!!*


## Customer Support Agent Creation and Configuration
In this section, you will create the Customer Support Agent, a collaborator agent designed to handle customer queries by retrieving relevant email threads and providing real-time order updates. This agent is powered by a combination of tools including the **Email Retrieval Tool** for accessing customer messages and the **Order Lookup Tool** for fetching order status. The agent mirrors real-world support workflows by curating responses and optionally sending emails to customers, all within a guided conversational flow.

12. If you are not at the watsonx Orchestrate landing page (chat interface), repeat the steps above to make sure you are logged into IBM Cloud, find the watsonx Orchestrate service and launch it to access the landing page.

13. From the watsonx Orchestrate langding page, click **Create agent** to start developing a new agent, the Customer Support Agent. 

![wxo landing page create agent](./images/wxo-landing-page-create-agent.png) 

14. On the Create an agent page, select **Create from scratch** tile , provide a **Name** and a **Description** for the agent and click **Create**.

Name: ```Customer Support```

Description: 
```
This agent is helpful for all the customer support queries. This agent fetches all user email addresses, retrieves order updates on user input (order id) from the tool, and sends a relevant email to the user with their respective order update.
```
As explained earlier, the decription of an agent is important as it is leveraged by the agentic solution to route user messages to the right agent skilled in addressing the request.

![wxo create customer support agent](./images/img1.png) 

15. On the agent configuration page, scroll down to **Toolset** section or click the shortcut. Then cick the **Add tool** button to bring up the window for adding tools to the agent.

![wxo agent tools](./images/img3.png) 

16. On the tool options pop-up, select **Import** as illustrated in the figure below. 

![wxo tool options](./images/img4.png) 
![wxo tool options](./images/img4.1.png) 

watsonx Orchestrate supports multiple approaches to adding tools to agents:

   - Add from catalog: The **Add from catalog** option enables you to add a tool from a rich catalog of pre-defined tools. The catalog of tools is actively being developed to make it even easier to add tools to agents.

   - Add from local instance: The **Add from local instance** option enables you to add a tool from an existing set of tools already uploaded to the local instance of watsonx Orchestrate. 

   - Import: The **Import** option enables you to import an external tool using an OpenAPI specification and selecting which operations you want to import as tools.

   - Create a new flow: The **Create a new flow** option provides you with a drag and drop tool builder interface to create a sequence of steps that utilize conditional controls and activities. 

For purposes of the Order-to-Cash Agent, you will use the **Import** option and then **Import from file** to import an OpenAPI specification and define which operations to import as tools. You will need a Openapi spec file which will be provided by your instructor. 

17. On the Import tool page, drag and drop the **customer_support.yml** spec file provided by your instructor and click **Next**.

![wxo tool import openapi](./images/img2.png) 

18. Next, select the checkboxes for the **Get Order Details**, **Get All Orders** and **Get All Mails** operations and click **Done**.

![wxo tool import operations](./images/img5.png) 

19. At this point, you will see the two tools imported under the Tools subsection which means they are available for the **Customer Support Agent** to use these tools in executing tasks. 

20. Next, scroll further down to the **Behavior** section or click the **Behavior** shortcut and add the following Instructions to guide the agent in its reasoning and orchestration.

Behavior instructions: 

```

*Congratulations!!* You have just completed developing the **Customer Support Agent** empowered with tools for returning email data and order updates.

## Order Management Agent Creation and Configuration
In this section, you will build the **Order Management Agent**, a key collaborator agent responsible for managing the end-to-end flow of purchase orders (POs) within the Order-to-Cash (O2C) lifecycle. This agent is designed to streamline order processing by interacting with external systems such as databases and ERP platforms (e.g., SAP), helping users retrieve PO and quotation details, validate input, and place orders efficiently. In this lab, the agent will be equipped with tools such as **Fetch All POs**, **Get Po Detail**, **Get Quotation Details**, and **Display Confirmation** to simulate real-world enterprise automation.

24. If you are not at the watsonx Orchestrate landing page (chat interface), repeat the earlier steps to make sure you are logged into IBM Cloud, find the watsonx Orchestrate service and launch it to access the landing page.

25. On the watsonx Orchestrate landing page, which is the Chat UI, click **Create new agent** link to start creating the Order Management Agent.

![wxo landing page create agent](./images/wxo-landing-page-create-agent.png) 

26. Repeat the steps you did earlier to create an agent from scratch and provide the following name and description for the order management agent. Click **Create**.

Name: ```Order Management```

Description: 

```
This agent is designed to handle user queries related to order management. It retrieves purchase order (PO) details along with the corresponding quotation information, ensuring users receive accurate and up-to-date data. Once the information is retrieved, the agent responds with a confirmation message: "Your order has been placed successfully."
```

![wxo create order management agent](./images/img12.png)

27. On the agent configuration page, scroll down to the **Toolset** section or click the **Toolset** shortcut, then click **Add tool**.

28. As explained earlier, watsonx Orchestrate supports multiple approaches for adding tools to agents. For the Order Management Agent, you will leverage the **Import** functionality like you did earlier. Click the **Import from file** tile.

29. On the Import tool page, drag and drop the **order_management.yml** spec file provided by your instructor and click **Next**.

![wxo order managemen agent tool import openapi](./images/img13.png) 

30. Next, select the checkboxes for the **Fetch All POs**, **Get Po Detail**, **Get Quotation Details**, **Get Matching Details** and **Display Confirmation** operation and click **Done**.

![wxo order management agent tool import operations](./images/img38.png) 

31. At this point, you will see the tool imported under the Tools subsection which means it is available for the **Order Management Agent**. 

32. Scroll down further to the **Behavior** section of the agent configuration page and add the following **Instructions** to help guide the agent's behavior.

Behavior instructions: 
```
### **Trigger Condition**
When a user initiates a conversation or asks a question containing the keyword 
```show all orders or order management or manage orders or related phrases.```

### **Step 1: Fetch and Display All POs**
* **Action**: Automatically trigger the `fetch_all_pos` tool.
* **Response Format (Example)**:
  ```Here is a list of all purchase orders:
  | PO Number   | POM ID | Submitted By     | User ID           |
  |-------------|--------|------------------|-------------------|
  | 4300016793  | 4697   | Sailendu Patra   | sailendu.patra    |
  | 4200054529  | 3426   | Tannavi Snehal   | tannavi.snehal    |
  Please enter the PO number you would like to view or manage.```

### **Step 2: PO Number Input & Validation**
* **Action**: Wait for user input (PO number).
* **Validation**:
  * If not found:
    ```
    No PO details found for the given PO number. Please try again or check your input.
    ```
  * If valid: Proceed to Step 3.

### **Step 3: Retrieve & Display PO details in a table format**
* **Action**: Call `get_po_details(po_number)` tool.
* **Response Example**:

  ```Please confirm the PO details shown above. Do you want to proceed with this PO? (Yes/No)```

### **Step 4: Fetch & Display Quotation details in table format**
* **Trigger Condition**: If the user confirms the PO.
* **Action**: Extract `quotation_number` from PO details and call `get_quotation_details(quotation_number)` tool.
* **Response Example**:

  ```  Please confirm the quotation details. Shall we proceed with placing the order? (Yes/No)```

### **Step 5: Confirm and Place Order**
* **Trigger Condition**: If the user confirms the quotation.
* **Action**: Call `display_confirmation` tool.
* **Response Example**:

  ```The order was placed successfully. You can track your order with Order ID: #710004927```

### **Design Principles**
* Ensure **one confirmation at a time** — first PO, then quotation.
* Avoid overwhelming the user with too much information at once.
* Validate user inputs and provide friendly recovery prompts if something goes wrong.
* Format messages clearly with clean markdown-style tables and highlights.

```

Next, test the functionality of the agent by asking a question such as

 ```manage orders``` 

  ```Show all orders``` 
  
  and its follow up questions and observe the response of the agent. Click the **Show Reasoning** link and note how the agent is correctly invoking the **Get All PO Details**, **Get Po Detail**, **Get Quotation Details**, **Get Matching Details** and **Display Confirmation** to retrieve relevant information.

## Conclusion
**Congratulations** on completing the hands-on lab portion of the bootcamp. 

To recap, you have used watsonx Orchestrate no-code functionality to develop a **Order-to-Cash Agent** skilled at helping order placement, invoicing, enhance customer satisfaction, accelerate cash flow, and deliver measurable impact to the bottom line by integrating intelligent agents and enterprise systems. You then added knowledge to the agent by uploading knowledge documents in the form of pdf files capturing O2C information.

Next, you augmented the **Order-to-Cash Agent** capabilities by developing two other agents, the **Order Management** and the **Customer Support Agent** which are empowered with tools to execute order management queries and also retrieve information from customer support regarding you order.
